I successfully completed a dynamic and enriching summer internship at Accetion Technologies in Bangalore, spanning from July 25th to October 9th, 2023. Engaged in a comprehensive curriculum, I delved into key areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud fundamentals, and Azure DevOps. During the internship, I familiarized myself with product development processes, gained insights into the company's day-to-day operations, and acquired a broad understanding of customer management. Demonstrating diligence, hard work, and an inquisitive nature, I actively contributed to the team. I am grateful for the valuable experiences gained at Accetion Technologies, and I look forward to applying and expanding upon the knowledge and skills acquired during this period in my future endeavors.
